### About Me

Hey there, I'm Akira. I'm a junior software developer, working with the usual suspects of NodeJS, Rails, and teaching myself the finer points of frontend design.  I also have worked in and hugely enjoyed unusual aspects of making awesome stuff with tech, like building my own cloud gaming PC, making music with Javascript, and growing gourmet mushrooms using a Raspberry Pi.  I love making life-enhancing projects that are aligned with the good life; good music, good food, good libations, and good friends; and am excited that code lets me have a direct impact on the quality of people's lives. I'm obsessed with good UX, and I think the web should not only be accessible but *usable* by everyone, regardless of cultural background or the color of their skin.

### Works in progress

Alarmed by the steep uptick in domestic violence calls since the Covid-19 lockdown, myself and some friends are developing a secure
web app to quickly match domestic violence victims with appropriate community resources based on their individual situation.
