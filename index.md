### About Me

Hey there, I'm Akira. I'm a software developer. I started my path in backend web development with Ruby and Rails, and I'm currently figuring out the mysteries of NodeJS, refining my CSS and JavaScript skills, and doing my best to not break the internet.

### Talks I've given

I've given talks! Like:

- [Refactoring in Ruby, Bend JavaScript](https://youtu.be/oii16rgOOYw?t=258)

- [10 Simple Rules to Not Go Batshit Crazy when Working from Home](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mhob2htsxi22sfu/10%20Rules%20To%20No%20Go%20Batshit%20Crazy%20When%20WFH.key?dl=0)

* Build Your Own Cloud Gaming PC using AWS EC2 services, Bend JavaScript (sorry, no link here! HMU and I'll teach you though :D )

### Stuff I've written

### Works in progress

Alarmed by the steep uptick in domestic violence calls since the Covid-19 lockdown, myself and some friends are developing a secure
web app to quickly match domestic violence victims with appropriate community resources based on their individual situation.
