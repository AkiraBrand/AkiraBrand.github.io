### About Me

Hey there, I'm Akira! Welcome to my digital garden!

I'm a software developer by trade, working with the usual suspects of Ruby, Javascript, React, and Rails, and I currently teaching myself the joys of server-side JS w/ Node and Deno.

I hugely enjoy unusual aspects of making awesome stuff with tech, like building my own cloud gaming PC, using homemade logic gates to build an entire computer from scratch with virtual hardware, making music with Javascript, and growing gourmet kitchen mushrooms with the help of a Raspberry Pi.

I love making life-enhancing projects that are aligned with the good life; good music, good food, good libations, and good friends; and I'm stoked that code lets me have a direct impact on the quality of people's lives.

I also have fresh excitement of someone new to coding but seasoned enough to actually have seen my ideas come to fruition with it; its incredible to me that with enough time and practice, I can make practically anything I can dream up a reality with the help of technology. I'm mature enough to know that of course, I won't make everything I want to while I'm alive on this planet, but I'm relishing in the full experience of having so many varied and vast things that I can make using the tools I'm learning every day.

I love to learn and I love to create, and you'll find all kinds of fun stuff here on my passions: tech, fermentation, reading, growing my own food, art, music, mental health, traditional plant medicine, philosophy, ethics, cultural explorations, economic theory, and being in the wilderness.

### Works in progress

Alarmed by the steep uptick in domestic violence calls since the Covid-19 lockdown, myself and some friends are developing a secure
web app to quickly match domestic violence victims with appropriate community resources based on their individual situation.
