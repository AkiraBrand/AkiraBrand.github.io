### About Me

Hey there, I'm Akira. I'm a software developer, currently spending the bulk of my time building out frontend UI interfaces with CSS and HTML, figuring out the mysteries of NodeJS, and creating excellent UX design.

### Talks I've given

I've given talks! Like:

- [Refactoring in Ruby, Bend JavaScript](https://youtu.be/oii16rgOOYw?t=258)

### Works in progress

Alarmed by the steep uptick in domestic violence calls since the Covid-19 lockdown, myself and some friends are developing a secure
web app to quickly match domestic violence victims with appropriate community resources based on their individual situation.
