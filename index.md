### About Me

Hi! I'm Akira!

I'm a software developer. I work in Javascript, Ruby, React, and Rails, and I'm learning the joys of server-side JS w/ Node and Deno. Someday I'll learn Typescript. Maybe someday I'll even learn Assembly.

I hugely enjoy unusual aspects of making awesome stuff with tech, like building my own cloud gaming PC, using homemade logic gates to build an entire computer from scratch with virtual hardware, making music with Javascript, and growing gourmet kitchen mushrooms with the help of a Raspberry Pi.

I love to learn, and learn in-depth. There's nothing more pleasurable for me than going deep into a subject for an extended period of time, and resurfacing from those depths to make unique, creative work.

I love to share and create, so here you'll find all kinds of tech resources as well as info on my passions: fermentation, reading, growing my own food, art, music, gestalt, theater, traditional plant medicine, philosophy, ethics, cultural explorations, economic theory, and being in the wilderness.

### Works in progress

#### Tripsitters

A communal guide to connect and educate those working legally in the Psychedelic space with people interested in using Psychedelics for therapeutic care and enhancing well-being.

We are undergoing a massive redesign and rebuild of the Tripsitters website, and I'm lucky to be the development team lead. We're in a wonderful exploration phase right now, with an emphasis on leveraging the open web, leveraging incredible visual design, and encouraging and facilitating organic community involvement.

[Check out our current website](https://www.tripsitters.com)

##### Haven

Alarmed by the steep uptick in domestic violence calls since the Covid-19 lockdown, myself and some friends are developing a secure web app to quickly match domestic violence victims with appropriate community resources based on their individual situation.
